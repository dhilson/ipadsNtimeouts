"Can I help you?" Jude asked Da Da.

"Da Da I help too," Olly said and ran out of the room excitedly.

"I don't have anything that you guys can help with now, but you can pour the cans into the pan in a few minutes" said Da Da distractedly, focusing on the onions in front of him.

"Ahhhh Ahhh..." said Jude who wasn't in the mood for waiting to help.

At this moment Jude heard a scraping noise, and looked to see Olly dragging a large white stepping stool from around the corner.

"I help" Olly whispered, as he walked past a staring Jude and behind Da Da, positioning the stool against the oven. He looked back to see Da Da hadn't looked up from his onions. 

Slowly, Olly climbed up the stool and stared at the pan being heated on the stove. He pointed to the pan and looked at Da Da "HOT," he said.

Da Da's neck whipped around to look at Olly, eyes wide with terror.

Olly beamed happily as he looked at the pan, pointed again, and looked back to Da Da, "HOT!!", he shouted.

In a blink Da Da had grabbed Olly from the stool and whisked him away plopping him gently on the living room couch.

Olly, having been so proud of his "helping", roared with displeasure.

Jude seeing an opening to do some helping of his own, grabbed the stool and moved it to the counter where Da Da had been chopping his onions seconds before. 

Jude climbed up to see the knife, onions and cutting board. He knew the knife was a big no-no, but putting the onions in the pan seemed like a perfectly reasonable way to help. He grabbed a handful of onions and stepped down from the stool. He started moving the stool to the stove, dropping bits of onion as he went. 

Just as Jude was about to climb up to drop the onions in the pan, Da Da returned from his heart-to-heart with Olly on the dangers of the hot stove. "What are you doing?" he asked Jude.

"I was just helping you" said Jude in the sweet voice he reserved for times when he knew he was on shaky ground.

"Are you supposed to get near the hot stove?" Da Da asked.

Before Jude could answer Olly ran into the room, much wiser than five minutes ago, and yelled "NO JUJU!, NO TOUCH, HOT!!".

"Be quiet Olly" Jude said clearly annoyed with his little brother.

"No, Juju be quiet" Olly yelled, ran up to Jude, and hit him awkwardly.

Jude roared, dropped the onions, and hit his brother solidly in the chest.

Olly fell to the floor, landing on soundly on his butt and bursting into tears.

Penny, who could be five rooms away and hear food drop to the ground, came running into the room making a beeline for the onions.

"TIMEOUT!!!", yelled Da Da.

Everyone froze (including Penny).

Da Da pointed to Olly, "You, corner", then to Jude, "You, pick up these onions and get over to the timeout couch", finally to Penny, "You, go lay down".

A chorus of whines sounded from the boys as they grudgingly obeyed Da Da.

Thirty minutes later dinner was on the table. The boys sat down at the table with Da Da and looked into their bowls.

"Chili again? I don't want it," said Jude.

"No Chili," said Olly.

The boys watched as Da Da put his head in his hands. He looked up and said, "How about we watch iPad and eat Chili?"

"YEAH!" cried the boys unison.
