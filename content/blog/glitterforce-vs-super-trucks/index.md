Jude stared at the dancing figures on the television as it the music for Glitter Force blared loudly.

"No Gli'er Force" whined Olly, "I want Super Trucks"!

Jude glanced over at Olly annoyed that he'd been distracted from his sparkly super heroes. "No Olly, it's my turn, you've been watching all morning".

Oliver's whine changed to a loud cry as he threw himself to the ground, arms and legs extended, tottering on his stomach as he arched his back, "I WANT SUPER TRUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS"!

Jude look over to his Da Da who was sitting at the kitchen table staring intently at his phone, oblivious to the fact that Glitter Breeze had just used Sparkle Blizzard for the first time and saved the world from Brooha the witch (and also the wails of Olly on the floor). 

"Olly, be QUIET!!", Jude yelled and grabbed the remote to drown out the toddler's cries with the Glitter Force celebratory concert, a tradition after they'd given the baddies a good drubbing.

Oliver, sensing his own performance wasn't having the desired affect, looked around for an object capable of bludgeoning. He had many options as toys were scattered across the play mat from an earlier dumping of all the toy crates (while he'd ignored Super Trucks on the TV). He decided on a medium size yellow fire truck that he could hold nicely.

Truck in hand, Oliver walked over and quickly bonked Jude on the side of the head, watching to see his reaction.

Jude who'd forgottern about Olly once the babies cries had disappeared, felt a sharp pain in the side of his head as the blow landed. His eyes welled with tears and he looked over to see Olly truck in hand, face scrunched angrily for having his Super Truck demands ignored.

"Owwwwwwwwww" Jude cried and pushed him away.

Olly, quickly recovering his balance, stepped forward and hit Jude again, this time in the face.

Jude cried loudly and looked to Da Da, who by now had set down his phone and was moving quickly to intercept Olly's third strike from landing. He arrived just in time to catch Olly's hand and remove the truck.

Tears streaming down his face, Jude pushed Olly again. This time Olly lost his balance and fell soundly on his butt and began to cry as well.

"Da Da, Olly his me with the truck" said Jude a pair of bruises welling on his head and face.

"Da Da, Juju push me" cried Olly, tears streaming down his face.

"What is happening down there?" came a shouting Mama's voice from upstairs.
